# FurryFriend.ai
 A fun and fluffy discord bot that I wrote to accomplish various tasks I needed or wanted on discord to save me time and effort.

 This was build so that I could test different functionality and features to impliment in other areas as well.
 
# Environment Setup

1. Setup a virtual environment
py -3.12 -m venv 

2. Activate your virtual invironment in your code editor (VS Code makes this easy btw so I highly suggest using that)

(Windows)
./Scripts/Activate.ps1

(Linux)
source bin/activate

3. Install the 'requirements.txt' dependancies to ensure all the current functions of the bot work properly

# Connecting to Discord
You will need to create a 'bot.conf' file that is in an INI format. Under the "Bot" header you will need to add the TOKEN key with your Discord bot token. Beyond that, it should all just work out of the box.
